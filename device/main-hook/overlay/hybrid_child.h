 * receives the child's stdout+stderr (O_APPEND); an unopenable path leaves the
 * parent's stdio, which under MiSTer is /dev/console.
 *
 * Detached on purpose: own session, no PR_SET_PDEATHSIG. On a core change
 * MiSTer execs stock Main_MiSTer in place of this process, and launch.sh's
 * watchdog (not this process) stops the engine; the fabric-gate core reload
 * also relies on launch.sh outliving the wrapper.
